        <p class="text">
         Adventure is a mental encouragement. It involves adventurous tasks that are wilfully chosen by an individual. Every person needs some break from the busy life. He/she looks around for the activities that can add some thrill to life. Adventurous activities like Mountaineering, Hiking, Sea Walk, River Rafting, Trekking, Bungee Jumping, Scuba Diving, etc are some of the adventures that can add some thrill to a persons life.
         <br><br>
         Finding delight in a smaller part of life can be an individuals adventure. Like, arranging a road trip with family or friends can be called an adventure. Encountering activities that involve physical danger, as well as mental satisfaction, are adventurous activities. A famous quote by Helen Keller says that “Life is either a daring adventure or nothing”.

            <h2 class="desc">PARA GLIDING</h2>
         </div>
         <p class="text">
            Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of flying paragliders: lightweight, free-flying, foot-launched glider aircraft with no rigid primary structure.[1] The pilot sits in a harness or lies supine in a cocoon-like 'pod' suspended below a fabric wing. Wing shape is maintained by the suspension lines, the pressure of air entering vents in the front of the wing, and the aerodynamic forces of the air flowing over the outside.
            <br> <br>
            Despite not using an engine, paraglider flights can last many hours and cover many hundreds of kilometres, though flights of one to two hours and covering some tens of kilometres are more the norm. By skillful exploitation of sources of lift, the pilot may gain height, often climbing to altitudes of a few thousand metres.

            <h2 class="desc">SURFING</h2>
         </div>
         <p class="text dev">
            Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or two in tandem surfing), uses a board to ride on the forward section, or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the surfer towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on ocean shores, but can also be found in standing waves in the open ocean, in lakes, in rivers in the form of a tidal bore, or in wave pools.
            <br><br>
            The term surfing refers to a person riding a wave using a board, regardless of the stance. There are several types of boards. The Moche of Peru would often surf on reed craft, while the native peoples of the Pacific surfed waves on alaia, paipo, and other such water craft. Ancient cultures often surfed on their belly and knees, while the modern-day definition of surfing most often refers to a surfer riding a wave standing on a surfboard; this is also referred to as stand-up surfing.
